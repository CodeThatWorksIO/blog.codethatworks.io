I Want To Change The World<br>
March 20, 2025<br>
<br>
It’s 2025 and the world... well, there’s just a lot going on right now.
<br>
<br>
I feel like they tell us that anyone can change the world, but they never tell us how to change the world.  I mean I guess in 6th grade I took a civics course (that I nearly failed because it was so boring) where I think they told me you go to a local representative, either in person or through a letter, who would then go to a state representative, who would then go to congress, who would then go to the president.  I could be wrong, again I almost failed the class, but I’m pretty sure this is what a lot of Americans believe.  I feel this advice is outdated.  Like this was great advice from the late eighteen hundreds (1800s) through the mid nineteen nineties (1990s), but we have the Internet now.  You should be able to create change without ever leaving your bedroom.
<br>
<br>
There’s also the idea of changing the world through technology.  People like the Facebook story about how some kid started a billion dollar business from his dorm room.  They push this narrative that Mark Zuckerberg was some kind of computer prodigy.  Honestly, maybe he knew a little PHP, but he was probably more interested in business than coding.  He knew he had a good idea and he just got a bunch of coders to help him build it.  And they probably weren’t even that best coders.  He probably just got whoever was close by.
<br>
<br>
Well, I have this theory, that if you have a good enough idea, it doesn’t matter if you know how to implement it or not.
<br>
<br>
In the United States they tell us that you need to either go to school, get a job, or start a business.  But what if this advice is wrong.  Has anybody ever bothered to question this advice.  Well I have, and I think there are other options.  I want to start a nonprofit organization.  I’m not sure if there are guides on this, but I believe you don’t need a guide.  An organization is just a group of people.  You don’t need paper work or formalities to create a group.
<br>
<br>
So, back to my idea.  What if we worked together to solve the problems of the world.  And when I say ‘we’, I mean the world.  I have two very big ambitions in life.  First, I want to teach the world to code.  Second, I want to unite the coders of the world in solving problems like hunger and poverty on a global scale.  I don’t believe these problems can be solved by a single country and I believe they should be our top priority, not who has the bigger GDP or who can make it to Mars first.
<br>
<br>
Here’s the thing... I’m not the world’s best programmer.  I don’t know the first thing about business.  And I’m not even a particularly good writer.  But what if you don’t need to be good at anything.  What if all you need is a vision.  What if one wish is all it takes to change the world.  I can’t promise that what I’m doing is going to work, but I owe it to the world to at least try.
